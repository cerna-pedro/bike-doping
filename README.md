# Doping in Professional Bicycle Racing

This repository contains the code used to create a scatter plot of professional bicycle races, and whether or not allegations of doping occurred.

The scatter plot was created with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) "Data Visualization with D3" curriculum.

Enjoy!
